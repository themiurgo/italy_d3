description = "Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Southern Europe. Italy has a largely temperate climate; due to its shape, it is often referred as lo Stivale. Italy is affected by many economic problems; because of low growth,  high corruption levels and rampant tax evasion, it has not taken advantage of adopting the Euro as currency in 2002. Desperetaly needed structural reforms are stuck in a hung parliament. Nevertheless, Italiy still has an enormous potential and is an active member of G8 Group. Will you bring it back to the glory of Rome?"
